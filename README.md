# Modular Blofeld UI - Max for Live Plugin

Max for Live Plugin to control the Waldorf Blofeld Synthesizer using MIDI CC commands.
The user interface (UI) is built in a modular fashion, allowing to only load the Oscillator or the Filter section.

The MIDI CC commands are based on the [user manual](https://cloud.waldorfmusic.com/index.php/s/kxS8Qn5ftR9Wa7w/download).

Currently, no SysEx messages are supported, however, this will perhaps be added in the future.
